This paper calculates the result of queuing network model by matlab.
1. MGM: this file is used to calculated the queuing network of Couple, SR-to-MP, SP-to-MR.
2. OQN: this file is used to calculate the queuing network of MP-to-MR.
3. AVMA: this file is used to calculate closed queuing network CQN2.
4. MVA: this file is used to calculate the fork-join queuing network in MP-to-MR.
5. k_equal: this file is used to calculate the K robots in closed queuing network CQN2.
6. Traveltime: this file is uesed to calculate the travel time.
7. Simulation_system: these files are used to smulate the collaborative modes.
8. Excel: these files record the experimental results.
